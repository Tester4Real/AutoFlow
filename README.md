# TurboFlow

TurboFlow is a Chrome MV3 extension for batch image and video generation on Google Flow. It runs from the side panel, uses the current Google Flow browser session, queues prompts, tracks generated media, and can download results automatically.

## Install

1. Open `chrome://extensions`.
2. Remove any old TurboFlow build.
3. Enable Developer mode.
4. Click "Load unpacked".
5. Select this `TurboFlow` folder.
6. Refresh the Google Flow tab and reopen the side panel.

## Prompt Index JSON

Use the JSON import button beside the text import button to load a `prompt-index.json` array with `file_name`, `image_prompt`, and optional `animation_prompt` fields. TurboFlow queues an image batch that uses bundled `assets/reference/Jack.jpg` as the shared character reference and downloads to the exact JSON `.png` paths, then queues an 8 second start-frame video batch for entries with animation prompts and saves the videos as matching `.mp4` files in the same folder.

## Switching Accounts

Use the Queue tab's Account button to open Google's account chooser without clearing local batches. After choosing the account, open a Flow project in that account, click Sync Folder if the Gallery or progress looks stale, then use Retry Failed. TurboFlow checks Chrome downloads and can scan the downloaded `media` folder to repair progress/thumbnails; for animation retries it uploads the still images to the current account/project and rewires failed clip prompts to those new start-frame media IDs.

## Version

Current manifest version: `2.2.21`.
